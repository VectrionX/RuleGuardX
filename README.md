# RuleGuardX 🛡️

**RuleGuardX** is a high-performance, enterprise-grade offline firewall rules auditor. Designed for Network Security Architects and Blue-Team Automation Engineers, it evaluates firewall configuration exports (CSV) to identify misconfigurations, excessive exposure, and lateral-movement risks using specialized security logic.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview
RuleGuardX provides a defensible risk assessment of firewall rules by correlating policy logic against real-world attack patterns. Unlike basic auditors, RuleGuardX performs context-aware evaluation of services, protocols, and network scopes.

### Core Analysis Capabilities:
- **High-Risk Service Mapping:** Identifies exposure of administrative (RDP, SSH, WinRM) and weak (Telnet, FTP, SMB) protocols.
- **Excessive Exposure Logic:** Specifically targets `ANY/ANY/ANY` rules and escalates severity based on destination sensitivity.
- **Subnet Scope Analysis:** Numerically evaluates CIDR sizes (e.g., /8, /16 vs /24) to flag broad trust relationships.
- **Policy Hygiene:** Detects shadowed rules, logic conflicts (Allow vs Deny), and latent risks in disabled policies.
- **Correlation Engine:** Analyzes rules as a set to find overlapping or redundant controls.

## ⚠️ Hard Constraints & Security
- **❌ No APIs / No Cloud:** All analysis is performed locally in your browser.
- **❌ No Vendor Lock-in:** Agnostic CSV ingestion with dynamic field mapping.
- **✅ Read-Only:** The tool analyzes policy exports only; it cannot make changes to your infrastructure.
- **✅ Zero Data Leakage:** Your firewall configuration never leaves your machine.

## 📊 Risk Scoring Model
RuleGuardX assigns a **Risk Score (0–100)** to every rule based on:
- **Critical (100):** Internet-facing RDP/SSH, ANY/ANY Allow rules.
- **High (80+):** Large subnet exposure, legacy plaintext protocols (Telnet/FTP).
- **Medium (50-70):** Logical conflicts, broad internal-to-internal rules.
- **Low/Info:** Technical debt, shadowed rules, and documentation gaps.

*Logic derived from NIST SP 800-41, MITRE ATT&CK, and CIS Critical Security Controls.*

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation
RuleGuardX is a standalone web application.
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. Alternatively, deploy the `dist` folder to any static hosting provider.

### Usage
1. **Export:** Export your firewall policy to CSV (compatible with Palo Alto, Fortinet, Cisco, Check Point, etc.).
2. **Import:** Drag and drop the CSV into the **Import** tab.
3. **Map:** Verify the column mappings (RuleGuardX auto-detects most standard headers).
4. **Analyze:** Review the Dashboard for high-level risk metrics and drill down into the **Findings** tab for remediation guidance.

## 📄 Output Artifacts
The tool generates localized reports for audit documentation:
- `firewall_findings.json`: Full technical breakdown of all risks.
- `summary_report.txt`: High-level executive summary of the policy posture.
- **Visual Charts:** Real-time generation of risk distribution and port exposure maps.
